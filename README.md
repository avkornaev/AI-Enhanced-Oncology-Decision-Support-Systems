This repository was developed using methodologies suggested by the Qwen (Qwen3-235-A22B-2507, 2025) language model.

## Problem Statement

Current AI systems in oncology often operate as black boxes, providing diagnostic predictions without transparent reasoning or confidence metrics, limiting clinical trust and adoption. While deep learning models achieve high accuracy on curated datasets, they struggle with uncertainty quantification, out-of-distribution generalization, and integration of diverse data sources including imaging, genomic information, and clinical notes. The disconnect between sophisticated AI capabilities and clinical decision-making workflows creates a barrier to meaningful implementation in real-world healthcare settings, where explainability and reliability are paramount for life-critical decisions.

- Week 5-6: Develop active learning component that flags uncertain predictions for human review
- Week 7: Evaluate on challenging cases (ACC ≥ 0.85, AUROC ≥ 0.92, uncertainty calibration ECE ≤ 0.05)
- Week 8: Prepare workshop paper draft focusing on uncertainty quantification methodology and clinical validation

### Project B: Multimodal Clinical Reasoning Assistant

**Description**: Develop a RAG-enhanced clinical reasoning system that integrates imaging findings with electronic health records and medical literature to support oncology decision-making. This project focuses on creating a system that provides evidence-based explanations for diagnostic suggestions with traceable sources.

**Milestones**:

## End Goal

The final deliverable for each project is a concise workshop paper (4-6 pages) suitable for submission to A* conferences. Each paper should:
- Document the proposed methodology and implementation details
- Present quantitative results against relevant clinical benchmarks
- Include analysis of failure cases and clinical limitations
- Discuss implications for clinical practice and potential integration pathways
- Propose future research directions for clinical validation

Successful projects may be combined into a full conference paper submission for MICCAI 2025, NeurIPS 2025, or Nature Digital Medicine.
